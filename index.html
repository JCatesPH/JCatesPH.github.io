	<h1>Jalen Cates</h1>
	<p>I'm a Senior at the University of Alabama majoring in physics and mathematics. Increases in computational power have allowed scientists to efficiently increase productivity in a number of areas, most notably <em>first-principles calculations</em> and biophysics. I am very interested in continuing to study statistical and condensed matter physics using computational approaches. I have experience in experimental and computational techniques, and I will be applying for physics graduate programs to begin in the Fall of 2020.
