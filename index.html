	<p>I'm a Senior at the University of Alabama majoring in physics and mathematics. I grew up in the Tuscaloosa area and first got inspired by an AP physics teacher. Over time, I have honed my interests and developed a passion for mathematics and physics. Increases in computational power have allowed physicists to increase productivity in a number of areas, most notably <em>first-principles calculations</em> and biophysics. These advances, however, have opened up more areas of research and revealed the ways other areas could be improved. I am very interested in continuing to study statistical and condensed matter physics using computational approaches. I have experience in experimental and computational techniques, and I will be applying for physics graduate programs to begin in the Fall of 2020.
