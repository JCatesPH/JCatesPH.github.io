    <h1>Efficient Computation of Quantum Properties with a GPU</h1>
    <h2>May 2019 - Present</h2>
	<p>I have been assisting <a href=http://tsegroup.ua.edu>Assistant Professor Tse</a></p> with implementing algorithms that would calculate quantities like the spin susceptibility of a two-dimensional material. The analytic solutions to these problems can be complicated and ugly expressions. Even the best implementations of Monte-Carlo integration will be very slow when run on the CPU, so we began by trying to use Numba's cuda interface. This was still too slow for values of interest. Current efforts are directed towards a C/C++ cuda version, which builds on <a href=http://madgraph.kek.jp/KEK/GPU/index.html>gVegas</a></p>.
