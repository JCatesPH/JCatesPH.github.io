    <h2>Efficient Computation of Quantum Properties with a GPU</h2>
    <h3>May 2019 - Present</h3>
    <p>I have been assisting <a href=http://tsegroup.ua.edu>Assistant Professor Tse</a> with implementing algorithms that would calculate quantities like the spin susceptibility of a two-dimensional material. The analytic solutions to these problems can be complicated and ugly expressions. Even the best implementations of Monte-Carlo integration will be very slow calculating these properties when run on the CPU, so we began by trying to use <a href=https://github.com/JCatesPH/zmc-numba>Numba's cuda interface</a>. This was still too slow for values of interest. <a href=https://github.com/JCatesPH/gvegas-tse>Current efforts</a> are directed towards a C/C++ cuda version, which builds on <a href=http://madgraph.kek.jp/KEK/GPU/index.html>gVegas</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Identification and Quantification of Chemical Vapors with Novel Sensors</h2>
    <h3>May 2019 - Present</h3>
    <p><a href=http://hauserlab.ua.edu>Assistant Professor Hauser</a> has been working on impedance-based chemical sensors for a few years, but any chemical sensor requires algorithms to interpret the complex output of the system. I have been working independently to write machine learning algorithms in python and tensorflow. The goal is a robust, cheap, and small system that can identify chemicals of interest.</p>
    
    <h2>Density Functional Theory and Heusler Alloy Stability</h2>
    <h3>January 2019 - May 2019</h3>
	<p>There has been a lot of interest in Heusler alloys for their tunability and interesting properties. There may, however, be a little too much hype. Theoretical techniques often do not account for defects or phase stability. <a href=http://hauserlab.ua.edu>Assistant Professor Hauser</a> and Graduate Student Sujan Budhathoki wanted to investigate the role of site swapping and alternate phases using Density Functional Theory to guide thin-film experiments.</p>
