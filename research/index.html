    <h2>Identification and Quantification of Chemical Vapors with Novel Sensors</h2>
    <h3>May 2019 - Present</h3>
    <p><a href=http://hauserlab.ua.edu>Assistant Professor Hauser</a> has been working on impedance-based chemical sensors for a few years, but any chemical sensor requires algorithms to interpret the complex output of the system. The Department of Defense has funded the sensor research to this point, and I have been working independently to write machine learning algorithms in python and tensorflow that will be deployable on our sensor platform. The goal is a robust, cheap, and small system that can identify chemicals of interest.</p>
    
    <h2>Efficient Computation of Quantum Properties with a GPU</h2>
    <h3>May 2019 - December 2019</h3>
    <p>I have been assisting <a href=http://tsegroup.ua.edu>Assistant Professor Tse</a> with implementing algorithms that would calculate quantities like the spin susceptibility of a two-dimensional material. The analytic solutions to these problems can be complicated and ugly expressions. Even the best implementations of Monte-Carlo integration will be very slow calculating these properties when run on the CPU, so we <a href=https://github.com/JCatesPH/zmc-numba>began</a> by trying to use Numba's cuda interface. This was still too slow for values of interest. <a href=https://github.com/JCatesPH/gvegas-tse>Current efforts</a> are directed towards a C/C++ cuda version, which builds on <a href=http://madgraph.kek.jp/KEK/GPU/index.html>gVegas</a>.</p>
    
    <h2>Density Functional Theory and Heusler Alloy Stability</h2>
    <h3>January 2019 - May 2019</h3>
    <p>There has been a lot of interest in Heusler alloys for their tunability and interesting properties. There may, however, be a little too much hype. Theoretical techniques often do not account for defects or phase stability. <a href=http://hauserlab.ua.edu>Assistant Professor Hauser</a> and Graduate Student Sujan Budhathoki wanted to investigate the role of site swapping and alternate phases using Density Functional Theory to guide thin-film experiments. We performed a number of numerical experiments, and the results are being drafted for publication. I am interested in pursuing similar research in the future, especially with interfaces and defects.</p>
    
    <h2>Off-Axis Combinatorial Sputtering of Novel Materials</h2>
    <h3>August 2018 - May 2019</h3>
    <p><a href=http://hauserlab.ua.edu>Assistant Professor Hauser</a> got his start by synthesizing complex systems with a novel sputtering process. The research is explained further <a href="http://hauserlab.ua.edu/novel-material-systems-via-low-energy-off-axis-combinatorial-sputtering.html">here</a>. I primarily assisted Graduate Student Sujan Budhathoki with material synthesis and record keeping. Recent work has been on producing high quality heterostructures, Heusler alloys, and other metallic films.

    <h2>Minutely-Doped YBCO Superconductors</h2>
    <h3>May 2017 - September 2018</h3>
    <p>My first research project was with <a href=http://hauserlab.ua.edu>Assistant Professor Hauser</a> and another undergraduate student. I started working independently on the project starting in June 2017. I was responsible for synthesizing samples, performing and analyzing x-ray powder diffraction, writing University of Alabama grant proposals, and presenting progress at undergraduate conferences. I still consult the student who is continuing the project; however, the synthesis process has not given satisfactory results.
